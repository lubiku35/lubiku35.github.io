#### Desktop Devices


Desktop devices with **minimum **width**** of **1200px** and **maximum width** of **100vw** which stands for 100% of the width of corresponding device  

#### Tablet Devices

Tablet devices are quite a tough topic cause we can include here various currently using classifications, from common tablets, portrait iPads, e-readers, landscape tablets iPads and more.

So that's why i decided to make this as much broad-speactral as possible.

Many internert resources says the minimum width of tablets is aroud 550px and maximum around 1025px. Cause of that i choosed two specific versions for tables:

**Smaller Tablets** with **minimum width** of 550px and **Larger tablets** with **minimum width** of 950px up to minimum width of desktop devices so with the maximum width of 1200px.

Also devices like notebooks are covered as a Desktop device.

#### Mobile Devices 

Probably most used devices nowadays so i covered mobile devices to 2 main specifications as tablets:

I should cover all mobile phones by adding a **minimum width** of 320px but not at all. Also there are 'bigger' phones which needs an independent category with **minimum width** of 480px.
